## Description
This was a fun little project for me to learn about working with API's in Python. At the moment, I only implemented it to work through the terminal and to where it only fetches the Pokemon name and pokedex number.

## How to compile
- Clone the repo
- Cd into the file
- Run using the command ```python pokemon_search.py```
